# FreeCodeCamp HTML Final Project

This repository contains my final project submission for the FreeCodeCamp HTML curriculum. The project showcases the skills and concepts learned throughout the course, including proper HTML structure, semantic elements, accessibility practices, and basic styling.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a structured and accessible web page using only HTML and minimal CSS. It demonstrates best practices in web development, focusing on semantic markup and user-friendly design.

## Features

- **Semantic HTML**: The web page is structured using semantic HTML5 tags such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc., ensuring the document is accessible and meaningful.
- **Accessibility**: Includes alt attributes for images, proper form labels, and ARIA roles where necessary, making the web page user-friendly for people with disabilities.
- **Responsive Design**: The page is designed to be responsive across different devices by using flexible layouts and media queries.
- **Basic Styling**: While this project focuses primarily on HTML, basic CSS is used to enhance the visual layout and improve user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (minimal use for styling)
